# About
This is an example program showcasing my [DFU BSDiff module](https://github.com/saralinnealindh/dfu-bsdiff-zephyr) which implements [DETools](https://github.com/eerimoq/detools) for [Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org/). It allows for incremental firmware updates, or [delta updates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_update), as an alternative to the standard procedure of downloading new firmware in its entirety.

The program itself is basically just a modification of the Zephyr sample program "Blinky" (which flashes LED 1 on a board) with the added functionality that when button 1 is pressed the program checks for a new patch and, if such a patch exists, performs a firmware upgrade. A developer may easily modify the program code to make the application flash LED 2 instead, create a patch, download it to the board, push button 1, and confirm whether the upgrade was successful by checking which LED is flashing.

### Key features 
The program was created for my [bachelorÂ´s thesis](https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12380/302598), which one may look through for implementation details, descriptions of the algorithms used, methodology, and suggestions for further research, among other things. For a brief overview one may refer to the list below:

* The program is only tested for [nRF52840 DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nrf52840-dk). However, it will likely very easily be ported to other [Zephyr supported boards](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/index.html).
* Zephyr v3.3.
* The delta encoding algorithm used is the DETools implementation of [BSDiff](http://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/) using [heat-shrink](https://github.com/atomicobject/heatshrink) for compression.
* The patching process makes use of three partitions: the primary partition, the secondary partition, and the patch partition. The current firmware runs on the primary partition, the new firmware is created on the secondary partition, and the patch is downloaded to the patch partition. Naturally, this means that the size of the patch partition puts an upper limit to the size of the patch. When the new firmware has been created, the device requests a swap of the primary and the secondary partition and reboots, as in the [normal upgrade scanario](https://www.mcuboot.com/documentation/design/#high-level-operation).
* Limited testing has resulted in patch sizes of 1.6 to 6.4 percent of target image size depending on the types of changes made. However, more extended testing has to be performed in order to make any generalized claims.

### Purpose 
Many resource-constrained IoT units are used in a manner which makes them inaccessible via cable and at the same time unable to receive large amounts of data using radio transmissions. Upgrading firmware is hence difficult or in some cases impossible. Integrating support for delta updates in the unit is a potential solution to this problem, as it significantly reduces the payload during an upgrade scenario. However, as of now there is no open-source solution for delta upgrades in embedded systems. The purpose of the application is to show that such a solution is achievable and that it causes a significant payload reduction.

# Environment Setup
Follow Zephyr's [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html) up to step 3.2 "Get the Zephyr source code". Here one should clone this repo and run the commands below instead of the ones in the guide:

    $ cd delta-updates-for-embedded-systems
    $ west init -l
    $ west update
    $ west zephyr-export
    $ pip3 install --user -r ./zephyr/scripts/requirements.txt
    $ pip3 install --user -r ../dfu-bsdiff-zephyr/scripts/requirements.txt
    $ pip3 install --user -r ../bootloader/mcuboot/scripts/requirements.txt

Then complete the remaining steps under section 4.

Additionally, one will need some external development tools. Return to the project folder and run `make tools` to install the needed python packages. Download and install [nRF Command Line Tools](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Command-Line-Tools/Download#infotabs) and [J-Link Software](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/) to enable some utilities for flashing and debugging the device.

# Example Usage
This small guide features some examples of how to use the program. A good place to start might be to perform them all sequentially.

### Build and flash the bootloader
If the device currently does not have MCUBoot installed the first step is to build it and download it to the device, which one does with:

    $ make build-boot
    $ make flash-boot

### Build and flash the Zephyr program
The next step might be to build and flash the firmware.

    $ cd app
    $ west build -p -b nrf52840dk_nrf52840
    $ west flash

Then it probably a good idea to put the binary in a good place where it won't be overwritten.

    $ mkdir -p ../binaries && cp build/zephyr/zephyr.signed.bin ../binaries/currently-running.bin

### Modify the program to flash another LED
In order to test the patching algorithm a new version of the program is needed. This is easiest done by modifying which LED light is flashing. This can be done by replacing `#define LED0_NODE DT_ALIAS(led0)` with `#define LED0_NODE DT_ALIAS(led1)` (or some other LED) in `main.c`. The "new" application can then be built with the same way as above.

### Create and flash the patch
Creating a patch requires step 2 and 3 to at some point have been completed, as a "currently running" and a "latest created" version of the software has to have been set. The patch created will contain instructions for how to transform the former of these into the later.

The commands for creating a patch and flashing it to the patch partition are:

    $ detools create_patch --compression heatshrink [source path] [target path] [patch file]
    $ python3 ../../dfu-bsdiff-zephyr/scripts/pad_patch.py [patch file] [max patch size] [patch header size]
    $ pyocd flash -e sector -a [storage partition location] -t nrf52840 [patch file]

This could for example look like:

    $ detools create_patch --compression heatshrink ../binaries/currently-running.bin build/zephyr/zephyr.signed.bin ../binaries/patch.bin
    $ python3 ../../dfu-bsdiff-zephyr/scripts/pad_patch.py ../binaries/patch.bin 0x6000 0x8
    $ pyocd flash -e sector -a 0xf8000 -t nrf52840 ../binaries/patch.bin

Again, its probably a good idea to put new currently running binary in a good place where it won't be overwritten.

    $ mkdir -p ../binaries && cp build/zephyr/zephyr.signed.bin ../binaries/currently-running.bin

### Upgrade the firmware
When the patch is downloaded to the patch partition and the program is flashing LED 1 it is time to start the patching process, which one does by clicking button 1. The LED should stop blinking for a few seconds while its creating the new firmware and reboots, and then start up again doing whatever one modified the new program to do.
